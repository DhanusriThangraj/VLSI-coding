// 18. Design an 8-bit counter by using a forever loop, named block, and disabling of named block. 
//   The counter starts counting at count = 5 and finishes at count = 67. The count is incremented at positive edge of clock.
//   The clock has a time period of 10. The counter counts through the loop only once and then is disabled. (Hint: Use the disable statement).
